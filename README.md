Python

This repository contains files from my Python Class at the University of Colorado-Boulder.It contains my homework,in-class exercies,and my final projct.A large percentage of the files need the accompanying csv's in the same folder or they will not run properly in Jupyter Notebook.A few of the files were too large to upload to Github.The jeopardy and winemag csv's were over 25mb and could not be uploaded.
